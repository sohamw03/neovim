# My NeoVim Configuration

This repository contains my personal neovim configuration. Feel free to use it or modify it to your liking.

## Prerequisites

- NeoVim v0.9 or later
- Git
- curl (for the plug-in manager)

## Installation

1. Backup your current NeoVim configuration if needed:  
```bash
mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim.bak
```

2. Clone this repository into your NeoVim configuration directory:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sohamw03/neovim.git ~/.config/nvim
```

3. Open NeoVim and lazy.nvim will install all plugins for you.

That's it! You should now be using my NeoVim configuration.

Please open an issue if you encounter any problems, or have suggestions for improvements.

Enjoy!
